= How-to =

This shows how to modify the output inside the internal link checker meta box (in case you want to extend its functionality):

<pre>
function modify_check_link_meta_box_content( $result, $links )
{
	global $post;

	// Uncomment the follwing line to see what the $links array contains
	// The links array contains all posts (and their respective data) that link to the current post
	/*
	echo '<'.'pre>';
		print_r( $links );
	echo '<'.'/pre>';
	 */

	// Now handle the result:
	foreach ( $result as $link )
	{
		// do stuff
	}

	return $result;
}
add_filter( 'internal_links_meta_box', 'modify_check_link_meta_box_content', 10, 2 );
</pre>
